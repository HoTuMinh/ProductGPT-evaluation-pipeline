1. **Document Submission:** Customers are required to complete and submit the required identity documents (such as KTP, SIM, Passport, KITAS/KITAP) along with the insurance application form [6c391e6f-da2b-4379-b4f1-b18ae2f18ee2, 1:2, ""No KTP / SIM / Passport / KITAS* (please attach a copy)""], [5b04770c-f309-4351-966b-0823d22e86ea, 4:5, ""Photocopy of KTP / KITAS / Passport""].

* Questions regarding high-risk businesses (e.g., foreign exchange trading, money transfers, car dealerships, jewelry companies, etc.) [6c391e6f-da2b-4379-b4f1-b18ae2f18ee2, 1:2, ""Do you have one or more of the following types of businesses: Foreign Exchange Trading (Money Changer), Money Remittance Services, Car Dealership, Gas Station, Parking Management Services, Jewelry Company (Gemstones and Precious Metals), Minimarket/Grocery Store, Electronics Retailer, Export/Import, Restaurant, Mobile Top-Up Merchant, Property Agent, Travel Agent, Lawyer, Accountant, Financial Consultant, Antique/Art Dealer, Offshore Company, including financial service providers located in tax and/or discretionary havens and jurisdictions that do not adequately implement FATF recommendations.]

It is important to remember that the principle of ""Utmost Good Faith"" requires the Insured to voluntarily disclose all material facts that could influence the insurer's decision to accept or reject an insurance application, or in determining the premium amount or other terms of the insurance agreement [3a8be1ed-6a36-4b77-941e-a63eb1d07c2b, 1:2, ""Utmost good faith means a positive duty to voluntarily disclose, accurately, and fully, all facts material to the risk being proposed, whether asked for them or not under the principle of ""full disclosure"" or ""duty of disclosure.""] If you are a PEP, this information is considered material and must be disclosed.

In addition, insurance companies are required to implement KYC principles and Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorism Financing, and Counter-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (AML-CFT-PPPSPM) provisions. If the company or authorized authorities request information related to the implementation of these principles, the Insured is required to provide it. Failure to provide the requested information may result in transaction rejection or policy cancellation [ebefc980-289c-4c24-ba19-40d96cd39909, 28:28, ""If we or the authorized authorities request information related to the implementation of KYC principles and/or AML-CFT-PPPSPM provisions, then the Insured is obliged to provide data related to the KYC principles and/or AML-CFT-PPPSPM provisions.""].

bunga.soraya@axa.co.id,Apakah bisa proses polis di mypage jika nasabah terindikasi pep?,"Berdasarkan dokumen yang tersedia, tidak ada informasi spesifik yang secara eksplisit menyatakan apakah polis dapat diproses sepenuhnya di MyPage jika nasabah terindikasi sebagai PEP (Politically Exposed Person).

Namun, dokumen-dokumen tersebut menekankan bahwa PT AXA Insurance Indonesia (dan PT AXA Financial Indonesia) wajib menerapkan prinsip ""Mengenal Nasabah"" (Know Your Customer/KYC) serta ketentuan Anti Pencucian Uang, Pencegahan Pendanaan Terorisme, dan Pencegahan Pendanaan Proliferasi Senjata Pemusnah Massal (APU-PPT-PPPSPM) [ebefc980-289c-4c24-ba19-40d96cd39909, 28:28, ""Kami berkewajiban untuk menerapkan hal-hal yang berkaitan dengan (Para) Tertanggung sehubungan dengan pelaksanaan Prinsip Pengenalan Nasabah (Know Your Customer atau “KYC""), dan ketentuan Anti Pencucian Uang, Pencegahan Pendanaan Terorisme, dan Pencegahan Pendanaan Proliferasi Senjata Pemusnah Massal (“APU-PPT-PPPSPM"") berdasarkan peraturan perundang-undangan yang berlaku.""].

Jika nasabah terindikasi PEP, hal ini kemungkinan besar akan memicu proses verifikasi dan penilaian risiko yang lebih mendalam. Dokumen menyatakan bahwa:

*   Jika nasabah tidak bersedia memberikan informasi/data/dokumen sehubungan dengan pelaksanaan prinsip KYC, dan/atau terdapat indikasi pelanggaran, maka perusahaan berhak untuk **menolak transaksi penutupan polis, membatalkan transaksi, dan/atau membatalkan polis** [ebefc980-289c-4c24-ba19-40d96cd39909, 28:28, ""Apabila (Para) Tertanggung tidak bersedia memberikan informasi/data/dokumen sehubungan dengan pelaksanaan prinsip KYC, dan/atau AML-CTF-PWMD requirements; dan/atau terdapat indikasi pelanggaran atas peraturan perundang-undangan mengenai KYC principles, dan/atau AML-CTF-PWMD requirements, then We will carry out its obligations in accordance with applicable provisions, including to refuse policy closing transactions, cancel transactions and/or cancel the policy.""].
*   Formulir aplikasi (yang dapat diajukan melalui MyPage) meminta informasi detail mengenai pekerjaan, sektor bisnis, dan apakah nasabah memiliki jenis usaha yang termasuk dalam kategori berisiko tinggi (misalnya perdagangan valuta asing, pengiriman uang, perusahaan perhiasan, dll.) [34dc46ac-d5a6-48da-a451-8d09ed7c60c7, 1:2, ""Sektor Bisnis Pemegang Polis"", ""Apakah Anda memiliki satu atau lebih jenis usaha yang termasuk di dalam jenis usaha berikut ini : Perdagangan Valuta Asing (Money Changer), Usaha Jasa Pengiriman Uang (Money remittance), Dealer Mobil, SPBU, Jasa Pengelola Parkir, Perusahaan Perhiasan (Batu permata dan logam berharga), Minimarket/Kelontong, Penjual Barang Elektronik, Ekspor/Impor, Rumah Makan, Pedagang Pedagang Isi Ulang Pulsa, Agen Properti, Agen Perjalanan. Pengacara, Akuntan, Konsultan Keuangan, Dealer Barang Antik/Seni, Offshore Company, termasuk penyedia jasa keuangan yang berlokasi di tax dan/atau screcy heaven dan yurisdiksi yang tidak secara memadai melaksanakan rekomendasi FATF""]. Informasi ini relevan untuk identifikasi PEP.

Meskipun MyPage memungkinkan pengajuan permohonan polis secara online [308d0e01-602a-4fd7-b855-b702ee2e6dab, 1:2, ""Tertanggung mengajukan permohonan kepada penanggung melalui website MyPage""], proses persetujuan akhir polis akan tetap tunduk pada hasil verifikasi KYC/APU-PPT-PPPSPM. Oleh karena itu, jika nasabah terindikasi PEP, kemungkinan besar akan ada intervensi manual dan permintaan dokumen atau informasi tambahan di luar proses MyPage standar untuk menyelesaikan penutupan polis.

However, these documents emphasize that PT AXA Insurance Indonesia (and PT AXA Financial Indonesia) are required to implement ""Know Your Customer"" (KYC) principles and Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorism Financing, and Counter-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (AML-CFT-PPPSPM) provisions [ebefc980-289c-4c24-ba19-40d96cd39909, 28:28, ""We are obliged to implement matters relating to the Insured (the) insured in relation to the implementation of Know Your Customer (KYC) principles, and Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorism Financing, and Counter-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (AML-CFT-PPPSPM) provisions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.""].

If a customer is suspected of being a PEP, this will likely trigger a more in-depth verification and risk assessment process. The document states that:

* If the customer is unwilling to provide information/data/documents related to the implementation of KYC principles, and/or there are indications of violations, the company has the right to **refuse the policy closing transaction, cancel the transaction, and/or cancel the policy** [ebefc980-289c-4c24-ba19-40d96cd39909, 28:28, ""If the Insured (s) are unwilling to provide information/data/documents related to the implementation of KYC principles, and/or AML-CTF-PWMD requirements; and/or there are indications of violations of laws and regulations regarding KYC principles, and/or AML-CTF-PWMD requirements, then We will carry out its obligations in accordance with applicable provisions, including to refuse policy closing transactions, cancel transactions, and/or cancel the policy.""].

* The application form (which can be submitted through MyPage) requests detailed information regarding the client's occupation, business sector, and whether the client has any type of business that falls into the high-risk category (e.g., foreign exchange trading, money transfer, jewelry company, etc.) [34dc46ac-d5a6-48da-a451-8d09ed7c60c7, 1:2, ""Policyholder's Business Sector"", ""Do you have one or more of the following types of business: Foreign Exchange Trading (Money Changer), Money Remittance Service Business, Car Dealer, Gas Station, Parking Management Service, Jewelry Company (Gemstones and Precious Metals), Minimarket/Grocery Store, Electronics Seller, Export/Import, Restaurant, Mobile Top-Up Merchant, Property Agent, Travel Agent. Lawyer, Accountant, Financial Consultant, Antique/Art Dealer, Offshore Company, including financial service providers located in tax and/or discretionary havens and jurisdictions that do not adequately implement FATF recommendations""]. This information is relevant for identifying PEPs.

While MyPage allows online policy applications [308d0e01-602a-4fd7-b855-b702ee2e6dab, 1:2, ""The insured submits an application to the insurer through the MyPage website""], the final policy approval process will still be subject to KYC/AML-CFT-PPPSPM verification results.

meilinda.anggraeni@axa.co.id,and how about the claim process? is this reimbursement?,"For SmartCare Executive, the claim process can be done through two methods: **cashless** and **reimbursement**.

1.  **Cashless Facility**: This option is available if you receive treatment at a hospital or clinic within AXA's Provider Network. If your claim is approved, AXA Insurance will directly pay for your treatment. For inpatient care, AXA Insurance will issue a Letter of Guarantee (LoG) to the network hospital [73d4417f-b37b-4565-a390-7e1dfdcffcc3, 225:233, ""Apabila Tertanggung berhak atas pertanggungan asuransi ini dengan Fasilitas Cashless, AXA Insurance akan melakukan pembayaran terlebih dahulu terhadap perawatan Tertanggung yang dilakukan di Rumah Sakit/Klinik yang termasuk dalam Jaringan Provider dengan ketentuan sebagai berikut: a. Tertanggung menunjukkan Kartu Peserta dan identitas diri lainnya, dan b. Melakukan pelayanan kesehatan di Rumah Sakit/Klinik yang termasuk Jaringan Provider sesuai haknya. 1.2 Rumah Sakit/Klinik Jaringan Provider akan melakukan prosedur standar sebagaimana disepakati dengan AXA Insurance. 1.3 Khusus untuk Rawat Inap, apabila AXA Insurance setuju bahwa tertanggung berhak mendapatkan pelayanan Fasilitas Cashless sesuai haknya, maka AXA Insurance akan mengeluarkan Surat Jaminan kepada Rumah Sakit/Klinik Jaringan Provider.""].

2.  **Reimbursement**: If the cashless facility is not applicable (e.g., if you choose a non-partner hospital or if the cashless facility is unavailable for certain reasons), you will need to pay for the medical expenses upfront. Afterwards, you can submit a claim to AXA Insurance for reimbursement [73d4417f-b37b-4565-a390-7e1dfdcffcc3, 235:238, ""Tertanggung hanya bisa mendapatkan pelayanan Cashless di rumah sakit rekanan dan jika karena satu sebab atau lainnya Fasilitas Cashless tidak berlaku di rumah sakit rekanan atau tertanggung mendapatkan perawatan di rumah sakit non-rekanan maka klaim akan diproses berdasarkan pengajuan klaim Reimbursemen dari Tertanggung.""].

**General Claim Procedure:**

*   You must submit a written notification to AXA Insurance within 30 days of the disability that incurs claimable expenses [5396244b-d87c-45e8-9f49-ddc116182e93, 347:349, ""Tertanggung wajib menyampaikan pemberitahuan secara tertulis kepada Penanggung dalam waktu 30 (tiga puluh) hari setelah terjadinya Ketidakmampuan yang menimbulkan biaya yang dapat diklaim""].

Berdasarkan harga jual Rp 150.000.000, mobil Anda termasuk dalam Kategori 2 (Rp 125.000.001 s.d. Rp 200.000.000) [15446b23-2184-4fe1-8295-8f5f5ac054d9, 11:12, ""Kategori 2	> Rp125.000.000,00 s.d Rp 200.000.000,00""]. Tarif premi Komprehensif untuk Wilayah 2 dalam kategori ini adalah antara 2.47% hingga 2.72% [15446b23-2184-4fe1-8295-8f5f5ac054d9, 11:12, ""2.47%	2.72%""]. Saya akan menggunakan batas atas tarif yaitu 2.72% untuk perhitungan ini.

Perhitungan premi dasar:
Rp 150.000.000 x 2.72% = Rp 4.080.000

Ditambah biaya materai sebesar Rp 10.000 [15446b23-2184-4fe1-8295-8f5f5ac054d9, 20:21, ""Biaya Materai : IDR 10.000""].

Jadi, perkiraan total premi untuk asuransi SmartDrive Komprehensif untuk Avanza Veloz 1.3 AT Anda adalah:
Rp 4.080.000 (premi dasar) + Rp 10.000 (biaya materai) = **Rp 4.090.000**

Perlu diingat bahwa ini adalah perkiraan. Premi akhir dapat bervariasi jika Anda memilih perluasan jaminan tambahan.

Apakah Anda ingin menambahkan perluasan jaminan tertentu?

Based on a selling price of Rp 150,000,000, your car falls into Category 2 (Rp 125,000,001 to Rp 200,000,000) [15446b23-2184-4fe1-8295-8f5f5ac054d9, 11:12, ""Category 2 > Rp 125,000,000.00 to Rp 200,000,000.00""]. The Comprehensive premium rate for Region 2 in this category is between 2.47% and 2.72% [15446b23-2184-4fe1-8295-8f5f5ac054d9, 11:12, ""2.47% 2.72%""]. I will use the upper rate limit of 2.72% for this calculation.

Basic premium calculation:
IDR 150,000,000 x 2.72% = IDR 4,080,000

Plus stamp duty of IDR 10,000 [15446b23-2184-4fe1-8295-8f5f5ac054d9, 20:21, ""Stamp Duty: IDR 10,000""].

So, the estimated total premium for SmartDrive Comprehensive insurance for your Avanza Veloz 1.3 AT is:
Rp 4,080,000 (basic premium) + Rp 10,000 (stamp fee) = **Rp 4,090,000**
